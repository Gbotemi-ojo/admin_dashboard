# this project has made me realize there are two main different ways in tackling projects with grids
# the first being tackling like its of different bits of pixels and creating as much as you can to fit your needs
# the second is creating a deep level of grid nesting which means you have to take control of every single bits of whats going on
# these are just my assumptions,lol nothing serious!
